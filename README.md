# Discrete Mathematics and Theory (CS 2120 @UVA) 

This repository is all of my notes and practice for CS2120. Since the policy of the class is that you're allowed to share notes and collaborate to study, I figured I'd make this repository public so that anyone who wants my notes can use it. The stuff in here consists of notes from the textbooks forall X and MCS, alongside notes from the CS2120 website and practice problems from the CS2120 website. 

The main reason I did this is becuase a lot of the readings are all over the place, both on different textbooks, different websites, and different sub-pages in websites. I also like to have the answers to practice questions readily available, as the practice, while super helpful, was hard for me to keep track of the answers because of the way the website was structured. I was a bit overwhelmed by all of this at the start, so making this organized helped me learn better. I think i've organized everything well so it's all in one (roughly) organized place. 

As you can tell, this is also the first class where I've seriously put effort into making good notes, using LaTeX and markdown simultaneously with Pandoc to make my notes functional, accurate, readable, and accessible.
