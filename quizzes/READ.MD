# IMPORTANT

This folder contains my work for all of the take-home quizzes and revisions/review of the in-class quizzes. NOTE: NONE of this work will ever be published to GitHub until after the quiz, as that is not allowed per the class rules/honor code. You can check the commits (use Le Git Graph or something) to verify me. 

Again, I want to reiterate that this repo is just an organized way for me (and anyone else who finds/uses it) to study the material.
