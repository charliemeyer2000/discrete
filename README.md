# Discrete Mathematics and Theory (CS 2120 @UVA) 

This repository is all of my notes and practice for CS2120. Since the policy of the class is that you're allowed to share notes, etc, I figured I'd make this repository public so that anyone who wants my notes can use it.

The main reason I did this is becuase a lot of the readings are all over the place, both on different textbooks, different websites, and different sub-pages in websites. It's hard to keep track of all of them, so I think i've organized everything well so it's all in one (roughly) organized place. 

If you want to take this dowm, email me: abs6bd@virginia.edu
